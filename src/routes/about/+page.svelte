	<p>Hello, my name is Braden, welcome to my blog. This blog is for documenting my programming projects, along with other miscellaenous thoughts. I'm really passionate about systems engineering, particularly compiler engineering. In Fall 2024, I graduated with my Masters of Computer Science from NC State University. I'll be joining Cisco's Security & Trust Organization in late January full time as a software engineer.</p>
